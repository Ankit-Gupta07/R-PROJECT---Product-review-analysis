# R-PROJECT---Product-review-analysis
Welcome to the Product Review Analysis project! This repository contains an R-based program designed to empower you to make smarter purchasing decisions when shopping online. By scraping and analyzing product reviews from e-commerce websites, this tool helps you gain insights beyond simple star ratings.

## Project Overview

Are you tired of struggling to make informed online purchases due to contradictory reviews? This project was created to help you make confident decisions by scraping and analyzing product reviews from various e-commerce websites. It addresses the challenge of deciphering reviews, especially when faced with a product that boasts a seemingly good 4.2-star rating but has hidden issues lurking within its 938 reviews. Manually sifting through such a vast amount of feedback is impractical. Likewise, even a 5-star-rated product with over 1500 reviews can leave you unsure about making the right choice. This tool automates the review analysis process, providing you with valuable insights to make smarter shopping decisions.
